RTB Integration

Set up OpenRTB, XML/JSON (we call it simple RTB), and direct API integration to automate the sales process, depending on your preference.

Supported traffic types:
Direct clicks, display banners with creatives

Authorization can be done either in the header or via the query string by adding it to the endpoint URL.


Supply Side (Publisher)

Supported integration types:
Open RTB (2.5/3.0), XML/JSON/API

Follow the steps below to integrate supply-side partners into the Open RTB auction.

Create an account in your network for the publisher if they don’t have one yet;
Provide the publisher with RTB documentation; (add domain variable to the link if needed) 
Set up the publisher’s site and separate ad zones for each traffic type, setting the bid rate as a payout type;
Share the ‘cid’ (ad zone ID) parameter with the publisher for every ad zone created;
Advise Publisher to pass clickid, email or email_encoded, cid, and utm_term into ext as per documentation;
Ask where they send the optimization parameters so you can check and adapt them to our utm_specific passing;
Create a test campaign to ensure that traffic flows smoothly. 

The endpoint link remains unchanged and includes the following:
2.5 or 3.0 depending on the OpenRTB version the publisher has selected:
e.g. https://rtb.domain.com/openrtb/2.5
2.5_cpm or 3.0_cpm to operate in CPM since the minimum bid price for these requests is expressed in CPC:
e.g. https://rtb.domain.com/openrtb/2.5_cpm
if the publisher would like to move authorization from the header to the query string, here are the parameters they should use:
affId - account ID
secretId - API key
cid - ad zone ID


IMPORTANT! 
If the publisher can balance the traffic from different locations to different endpoints, use the following subdomains for the endpoint:
- US, CA, LATAM - rtbus.domain.com  subdomain
 e.g. https://rtbus.domain.com
- the rest of the world - rtbeu.domain.com subdomain
e.g. https://rtbeu.domain.com
the ID of the bid request can be just a random number that repeats itself, but it has to be present;
you’ll find affId (ACCOUNT_ID) and secretId (API_KEY) in the RTB Documentation > Authorizations section (you need to log in as the publisher) (screenshot 1)

Endpoint examples:

Open RTB - Authorization in the header
https://rtb.domain.com/openrtb/2.5

Open RTB - Authorization in the URL
https://rtb.domain.com/openrtb/2.5_cpm?affId=…&secretId=…&cid=ad_zone_ID

XML/JSON link
https://rtb.domain.com/rtb/basic/[cid]?affId= …&secretId=…&id=...&ip=...&useragent=...&lang=...&other_parameters=...


Demand side (Advertiser)

Supported integration types:
Open RTB (2.5/3.0), XML/JSON, API

Note that Open RTB 2.5 or 3.0 is available for integration between BitBuilder platform networks.

Supported traffic types:
Direct clicks, display banners with creatives

Use the following instructions to integrate a demand-side partner via Open RTB, XML/JSON, or API:

Third-party service integration:

Create an advertiser account in your network if an advertiser doesn’t have one yet;
Get documentation for the API or RTB integration from the advertiser;
Agree with an advertiser on the traffic type;
Get all the necessary credentials for the API/auction access;
Pass all the info on to the BidBuilder support team for integration;
Once development is completed, your new demand partner will appear in the list in your campaigns;
Set up the Advertiser campaign with targeting and bids: 
Set up API (RTB/XML/JSON auction) or API buying type in step 1 (screenshot 2). 
Select the advertiser from the list on step 2 Links > Add demand partner button (screenshot 3);
Add the details of your ad zone in the partner network and finish campaign creation.
Watch Raw logs to make sure all is working correctly and clicks are being sold;
Copy campaign if more is needed (do not create them from scratch!).

BidBuilder has a pool of pre-integrated demand partners. So please check if your prospect partner is on the list when creating a campaign and adding a demand partner. In case you don’t see it, contact the B2B manager.

Integration between BidBuilder networks:

If you are a supply partner (sell traffic):

Ask your partner to create a publisher account for you in THEIR network;
Log in to that account and take affId and secretId on the RTB documentation page;
Create an advertiser account for your demand partner in YOUR network if they don’t have one yet;
Create a campaign: 
set any version of RTB for buying type on step 1 (screenshot 4);
select the required demand partner from the dropdown list on step 2 (screenshot 5)
Watch traffic to make sure all is working correctly and clicks are being sold;
Copy campaign if more is needed (do not create them from scratch!).
